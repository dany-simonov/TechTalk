This project is a Flask-based web application for a word-guessing game called "TechTalk," designed for language learners. 
It features two languages (English and Russian), multiple difficulty levels (A1-C2), and thematic word categories (IT, Economics, Business). 
Users can directly provide feedback to the developer, enhancing the game's community aspect. 
The application uses web scraping and API integration for word lists.
